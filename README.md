# Tweepy-Tweet-Library
This is a python program that I have created for fun thats main purpose was to help me learn about the real world applications of python programing. Essentially what my program does is it opens up a stream to twitter using the tweepy package, and will gather tweets that contain the hashtags #startup, #entrepreneur, and #smallbusiness. Once three tweets have been gathered in real time the stream will disconect and you will be able to view the tweets through the terminal window. From there, using input prompts, you are able ot view cirtain data that has been collected about each of the tweets(such as the length of the tweet, when it was created, etc.). The program itself is slightly unfinished as I had planned to add a few more categories of data that could be accessed, however the project began feeling very repetetive, and I wanted to move onto something new that I could work on and learn from.
